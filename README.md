# My personal dotfiles

Clone to ~/dotfiles directory (must be named exactly `dotfiles`),
run `./dotfiles/install` to create the symbolic links.

## Limitations

The install script will create symbolic links to whole directories, instead of
recursively creating links to files under a directory tree.
